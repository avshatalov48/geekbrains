Overview
========================================
PassMark's MemTest86 is a standalone memory testing software for x86 computers.
MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for 
faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns.
<For more details see the MemTest86 User Guide>


Requirements
========================================
- x86 System (Mac and PC)
- USB Flash drive (>= 256MB capacity)


Creating a bootable USB drive
========================================
 - Plug in your USB drive.
 - Launch the included ImageUSB application.
 - Select your USB drive from the list (Step 1).
 - Select 'Write image to USB drive' (Step 2)
 - If it is not already selected, select the included image file (Step 3).
 - Click 'Write' (Step 4).

After accepting a few more prompts this should give you a working
bootable USB drive.


Booting the MemTest86 USB drive
========================================
This USB drive supports dual booting on UEFI and BIOS platforms. 
Most newer systems are able to run the UEFI version of MemTest86.
On machines that don't support UEFI, the older V4 BIOS release of MemTest86 
will be automatically booted.

To boot from the drive you may need to go into your BIOS settings and
alter your boot order. Or launch the boot menu at system startup.
The methods for doing this will vary depending on your motherboard.

To start MemTest86 insert the USB flash drive into the appropriate drive and 
restart your computer. If running on a UEFI system, the UEFI BIOS must be configured 
to boot from the device that MemTest86 is installed on. Most systems have an optional 
boot menu that is enabled by pressing a key at startup (often ESC, F9, F11 or F12).

If available use the boot menu to select the correct drive. 
You may see both the UEFI and BIOS as separate options. 
Please consult your motherboard documentation for details.

On a Mac, you need to hold down the 'c' key while the computer is booting to boot from CD. 
To boot from USB, you need to hold down the ALT / Option key on the Mac keyboard 
while powering on the machine.


Reclaiming disk space from the USB drive
========================================
You may have noticed that the MemTest86 USB drive you have created may have lost some 
disk space and normal formatting will not recover the lost space. 
For example, this can happen when a UFD contains multiple partitions, such as the
MemTest86 image. Formatting will not span across multiple partitions/volume. 
To erase the partition records and reclaim the whole disk, you will need to 
zero the MBR.

WARNING: THIS PROCESS WILL COMPLETELY DELETE THE DATA ON THE DRIVE

1. Insert UFD.
2. Launch imageUSB and select the appropriate UFD. (Be careful and select the correct drive!).
3. Choose the Zero UFD option & Run.
4. Drive MBR is now Zeroed. You will need to reinsert the drive for Windows to recognize it 
   and prompt for formatting before you can use it again. A normal format will now recover 
   the full capacity of the USB drive.
